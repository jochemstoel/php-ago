# PHP Ago()
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jochemstoel/php-ago/master/ago.jpg">
Convert the difference between a given timestamp and the present moment to human language. This could be used for a newsfeed like Facebook to show when something is posted.

## Example
```php
include 'ago.php';

echo ago(1456377246); // 14 minutes ago.
``` 

## Languages
Currently I have included the following languages:
* English
* Dutch

Editing this file to meet your personal requirements should be really simple.

## ToDo
I will at some point include a version for every language. Feel free to submit your own to make the world a better place for humans
